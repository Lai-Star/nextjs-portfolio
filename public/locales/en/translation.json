  "about-text-top": "Hi! My name is Jayson Layug and I like to make things for software. I am from the Philippines. Since graduating from the Department of Information Engineering at the University of Diliman in the Philippines in 2016, I have been working on various projects at Japanese companies. Since I have the opportunity to work on various projects at the same time, it feels like I can try different dishes. I wonder how the new person will do, and even if I have done something before, I can do it better than before, so I think it depends on how I set my own goals.",
